## Hungry Game
Hungry Game is a simple javascript game. It is an exploration of minimalistic and intuitive game design that aims to be fun without sacrificing challenge and gameplay.


### Summary
I will be using P5 to build a simple game to explore some of the game thinking design concepts that I've learned this year. I was inspired by stories of beetles (Ant-nest beetle and the Rove beetle) who had special evolutionary adaptions that allowed them to infiltrate ant colonies and live off their harvested food or devour their larvae. These beetles had adapted to mimic the physical appearance and behavior of the ants and some even secreted a kind of scent that made the ants happier. 
I also was inspired by optical illusions and thought that the simple shapes that we were learning to make and animate would be a natural form and medium to use to incorporate that effect into the gameplay. 

Players will use the arrow keys to move the Beetle to eat the Food and grow in size. The player must manuever around the poisonous Ants which induce a short-term hallucination that makes it difficult to see; touching the Ants will also revert the Beetle back to its original size. The Beetle will grow in size, increasing the difficulty of reaching the Portal without being touched by the Ants. The game is won when the Beetle has eaten enough food to activate and enter the Portal.


### Component Parts
The game uses P5. I also used some crucial sound effects from www.freesound.org


### Timeline
Week 0: Write Proposal
Week 1: Think about ideas and look at other javascript examples;
Week 2: Think about ideas for API data visualization;
Week 3: Decide to do the game. Figure out game mechanics and objectives and build the code.
Week 4: Present!

### Challenges
It was challenging to do some of the math. Figuring out how identify when the the Beetle was located mostly in the center of the Portal took some time. Also the math for making some of the Ants chase the Beetle was difficult. 

It was also surprising that the simpler version of the Hallucination was more effective in fatiguing and distracting the eyes than the more complicated versions. Which is great because it was more elegant and easier to maintain.

I also was surprised at how much sound makes the game more like a game. It honestly felt a little boring without the effects and soundtrack. I was happy that I decided to add that in. 

It was also interesting to see how little tweaks like increasing or decreasing the variables (like the number of Ants or the size of the Beetles or Portal) by just a little bit has a huge effect on the difficulty level of the game play. This is encouraging b/c it provides natural ways to make levels of increasing difficulty with different kinds of challenges.

#### Other Help:
I got some help from Valentyn Tymofieiev who taught me how to tidy my code, use functions to make the code more modular and manageable and helped me with some of the tricky math parts.
